# Breast_Cancer_Meets_Machine_Learning


The project focus on what we can do with the data when machine learning algorithms are used to find some relation or verify correlations that are already available among the variables. I get the data from the professor, and by using Weka, started applying different classification methods and functions on it, so that I could get different results. Then with some of the variables that I got, I made different models using R to implement functions such as decision tree, neural net, etc. The Codes which I used here are mostly written by me and uses multiple R packages.
